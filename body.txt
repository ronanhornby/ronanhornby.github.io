The theory of evolution as proposed by Charles Darwin in the 19th century, is one of the most unbelievable and irrational claims in history. Despite this, over its 150-year history the people who have accepted it have failed to produce and scientific evidence, supporting the theory. The theory puts forth the irrational claim that all living organisms, plants, animals, and human beings are the result of a blind, unconscious, accidental events. Evolutionists believe that millions of years ago, in the primal soup of the oceans or pools of water, mindless atoms with no knowledge, powers of reason came together in certain proportions and later, by change, formed the proteins and cells that even today's scientists with most advanced laboratory technology have not been able to duplicate. They go so far as to say that these cells, in their turn- and again by sheer chance- formed starfish, sparrows, hawks, penguins, cats, lambs, loins, apples, apricots, pomegranates, figs and even human beings. If human efforts cannot produce any living thing by using the whole pool of human knowledge, how can life be brought into being with the aid of unconscious atoms and chance events? Any intelligent human being of conscience can certainly understand that all living things including himself cannot be the result of chance vents.
